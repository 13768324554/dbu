# Disk utilities

__manage and configure disk drives and media__

```

GNOME Disks is a tool to manage disk drives and media:

 * Format and partition drives.
 * Mount and unmount partitions.
 * Query S.M.A.R.T. attributes.

It utilizes udisks.
Disk Usage Analyzer is a graphical, menu-driven application to analyse
disk usage in a GNOME environment. It can easily scan either the whole
filesystem tree, or a specific user-requested directory branch (local or
remote).

It also auto-detects in real-time any changes made to your home
directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. Disk Usage Analyzer
also provides a full graphical treemap window for each selected folder.
TestDisk checks the partition and boot sectors of your disks.
It is very useful in forensics, recovering lost partitions.
It works with :
 * DOS/Windows FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32
 * NTFS ( Windows NT/2K/XP )
 * Linux Ext2 and Ext3
 * BeFS ( BeOS )
 * BSD disklabel ( FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD )
 * CramFS (Compressed File System)
 * HFS and HFS+, Hierarchical File System
 * JFS, IBM's Journaled File System
 * Linux Raid
 * Linux Swap (versions 1 and 2)
 * LVM and LVM2, Linux Logical Volume Manager
 * Netware NSS
 * ReiserFS 3.5 and 3.6
 * Sun Solaris i386 disklabel
 * UFS and UFS2 (Sun/BSD/...)
 * XFS, SGI's Journaled File System

PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover
lost pictures from digital camera memory or even Hard Disks.
It has been extended to search also for non audio/video headers.
It searches for following files and is able to undelete them:
 * Sun/NeXT audio data (.au)
 * RIFF audio/video (.avi/.wav)
 * BMP bitmap (.bmp)
 * bzip2 compressed data (.bz2)
 * Source code written in C (.c)
