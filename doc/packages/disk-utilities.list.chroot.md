# Disk utilities

__manage and configure disk drives and media__

```

GNOME Disks is a tool to manage disk drives and media:

 * Format and partition drives.
 * Mount and unmount partitions.
 * Query S.M.A.R.T. attributes.

It utilizes udisks.
GParted uses libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition
tables while several (optional) filesystem tools provide support for
filesystems not included in libparted.

Disk Usage Analyzer is a graphical, menu-driven application to analyse
disk usage in a GNOME environment. It can easily scan either the whole
filesystem tree, or a specific user-requested directory branch (local or
remote).

It also auto-detects in real-time any changes made to your home
directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. Disk Usage Analyzer
also provides a full graphical treemap window for each selected folder.
