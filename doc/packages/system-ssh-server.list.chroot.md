# OpenSSH server

__secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines__

```

This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
group.

Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
and for executing commands on a remote machine.
It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
channel.

This package provides the sshd server.

In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
without a special permit.

sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
purposes.
