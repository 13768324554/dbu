# Text editor

__simple Xfce oriented text editor__

```

Mousepad is a graphical text editor for Xfce based on Leafpad.

The initial reason for Mousepad was to provide printing support, which would
have been difficult for Leafpad for various reasons.

Although some features are under development, currently Mousepad has the
following features:
  * Complete support for UTF-8 text
  * Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text
  * Search and Replace
  * Font selection
  * Word Wrap
  * Character coding selection
  * Auto character coding detection (UTF-8 and some code-sets)
  * Manual code-set setting
  * Infinite Undo/Redo by word
  * Auto Indent
  * Multi-line Indent
  * Display line numbers
  * Drag and Drop
  * Printing

```
