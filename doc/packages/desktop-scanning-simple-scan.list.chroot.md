# Simple-scan document scanning

__Simple Scanning Utility__

```

Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users
connect their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an
appropriate format.

Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same
backend as XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will
work and the interface is well tested.
