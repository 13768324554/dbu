# Light-locker screen locker

__simple screen locker for lightDM display manager__

```

light-locker is a simple screen locker that aims to have simple, sane, secure
defaults and be well integrated with the desktop while not carrying any
desktop-specific dependencies.

It relies on lightdm for locking and unlocking your session via
ConsoleKit/UPower or logind/systemd.
