# Image editor

__The GNU Image Manipulation Program__

```

GIMP is an advanced picture editor. You can use it to edit, enhance, and
retouch photos and scans, create drawings, and make your own images.
It has a large collection of professional-level editing tools and
filters, similar to the ones you might find in Photoshop. Numerous
fine-control settings and features like layers, paths, masks, and
scripting give you total control over your images.

Many image file formats are supported, including JPEG, Photoshop (.psd),
and Paint Shop Pro (.psp) files. It can also be used to scan and print
photos.

To open files remotely (like over HTTP), install the gvfs-backends
package.

To use a MIDI device (like a musical keyboard) as an input controller in GIMP,
install libasound2 and read the how-to at /usr/share/doc/gimp/README.MIDI
The Create Project provides shared resources for use by creative
applications such as Blender, CinePaint, the GIMP, Inkscape, and Scribus.

The package includes brushes, color swatches files, gradients, etc. , so
that the user doesn't need to install all of these resources separately
for each and every application that can read such data.
