# Video player

__library for reading DVDs__

```

VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4,
DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, WebM, FLAC, MP3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs,
podcasts, and multimedia streams from various network sources.

VLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates the stream it
reads and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves
them through HTTP.

VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either
for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for
most output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added by
installing additional plugins (vlc-plugin-fluidsynth, vlc-plugin-jack,
vlc-plugin-notify, vlc-plugin-samba, vlc-plugin-sdl, vlc-plugin-svg,
vlc-plugin-zvbi).
