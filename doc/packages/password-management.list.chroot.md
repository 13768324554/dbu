# Password and keys management

__GNOME front end for GnuPG__

```

Seahorse is a front end for GnuPG - the GNU Privacy Guard program -
that integrates to the GNOME desktop. It is a tool for secure
communications and data storage.  Data encryption and digital signature
creation can easily be performed through a GUI and Key Management
operations can easily be carried out through an intuitive interface.
Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
Setup (LUKS) support.

Cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.
pwgen generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords.
These passwords contain either only lowercase letters, or upper
and lower case mixed, or digits thrown in.
Uppercase letters and digits are placed in a way that eases
remembering their position when memorizing only the word.
