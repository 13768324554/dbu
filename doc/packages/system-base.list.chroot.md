# Base system and hardware support

__ConsoleKit PAM module__

```

ConsoleKit is a system daemon for tracking what users are logged
into the system and how they interact with the computer (e.g.
which keyboard and mouse they use).

This package provides a PAM module which can be used for console logins.
Graphical login managers should talk to ConsoleKit directly.
