# WINE/PlayOnLinux Windows compatibility layer

__front-end for Wine__

```

PlayOnLinux is a front-end for wine. It permits you to easily install Windows
Games and software on Linux. It is advised to have a functional internet
connection.
Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
This is still a work in progress and many applications may still not work.

This package provides essential wrappers and convenience tools for the
standard Wine components. It also employs the Debian alternatives system to
provide the usual command names, e.g. "wine" instead of "wine-stable".
