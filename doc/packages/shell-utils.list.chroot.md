# Command line shell utilities

__pager program similar to more__

```

This package provides "less", a file pager (that is, a memory-efficient
utility for displaying text one screenful at a time). Less has many
more features than the basic pager "more". As part of the GNU project,
it is widely regarded as the standard pager on UNIX-derived systems.

Also provided are "lessecho", a simple utility for ensuring arguments
with spaces are correctly quoted; "lesskey", a tool for modifying the
standard (vi-like) keybindings; and "lesspipe", a filter for specific
types of input, such as .doc or .txt.gz files.
