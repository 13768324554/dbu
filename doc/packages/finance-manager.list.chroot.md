__Manage your personal accounts at home__

```

HomeBank is a fast, simple and easy to use program to manage your personal
accounting.
It differs from gnucash for the better look and feel, and for the greatest
start-up speed. It has a lot of features such as easy analysis with
graphical charts (statistics, budget, overdrawn, car cost), useful reports
("Where your money goes", "Trend Time Report" ), multi-accounts  support,
budget management, reminder, import from  OFX/QFX-CSV files, visual status
of operations.  It is based on GTK2.
