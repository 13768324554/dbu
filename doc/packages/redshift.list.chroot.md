# Redshift

__Adjusts the color temperature of your screen with GTK+ integration__

```

The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
adapt.

This package provides GTK+ integration.
