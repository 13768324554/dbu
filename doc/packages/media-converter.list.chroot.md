# Multimedia file converter

__graphical video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg or avconv__

```

WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg or avconv. It will convert
almost any video file that FFmpeg or avconv will convert. WinFF does multiple
files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert
mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp
etc.) all at once.

WinFF provides a variety of preset conversion settings for
common formats and devices. These presets are intended to hit the
"sweet spot" for each individual codec. They have been written with a
tip of the balance to quality.

For most presets to work, it is necessary to have the unstripped version
of the libavcodec package, which can be obtained by installing
libavcodec-extra as suggested by the WinFF suite. It might be necessary
to enable additional repositories to find that package.

This package is a metapackage to pull in either the GTK+ or Qt variant.
