__Live System Boot Components__

```

The Live Systems project maintains the components to build Debian based Live
systems and the official Debian Live images themselves.

live-boot contains the components to configure a live system during the boot
process (early userspace).

In addition to live-boot, a backend for the initrd generation is required, such
as live-boot-initramfs-tools.
