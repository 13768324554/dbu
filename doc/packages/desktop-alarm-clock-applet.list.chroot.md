Alarm Clock is a fully-featured alarm clock which resides in the notification
area. It is easy to use yet powerful with support for multiple and repeatable
alarms, as well as snoozing and a flexible notification system.

Two types of alarms are supported: Alarm Clocks and Timers.
Notification is done by either playing a sound or launching an
application.
