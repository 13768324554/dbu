# Document scanning and OCR

__Simple Scanning Utility__

```

Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users
connect their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an
appropriate format.

Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same
backend as XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will
work and the interface is well tested.
OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character
recognition system.

Given the images it will automatically outline its contents,
distinguish between what's graphics and text and perform OCR over the
latter. It generates multiple formats being its main one ODT.

It features a complete GTK+ graphical user interface that allows the
users to correct any unrecognized characters, defined or correct
bounding boxes, set paragraph styles, clean the input images, import
PDFs, save and load the project, export everything to multiple
formats, etc.
