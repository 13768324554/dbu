# Plymouth boot screen

__boot animation, logger and I/O multiplexer__

```

Plymouth provides a boot-time I/O multiplexing framework - the most obvious
use for which is to provide an attractive graphical animation in place of
the text messages that normally get shown during boot. (The messages are
instead redirected to a logfile for later viewing.) However, in event-driven
boot systems Plymouth can also usefully handle user interaction such as
password prompts for encrypted file systems.

This package provides the basic framework, enabling a text-mode animation.
