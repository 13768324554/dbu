__front-end for Wine__

```

Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
This is still a work in progress and many applications may still not work.

This is a virtual package that depends on the standard Wine components.
PlayOnLinux is a front-end for wine. It permits you to easily install Windows
Games and software on Linux. It is advised to have a functional internet
connection.
