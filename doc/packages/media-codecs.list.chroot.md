# Multimedia codecs

```

GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
installing new plug-ins.

This package contains the GStreamer plugins from the "base" set, an
essential exemplary set of elements.
