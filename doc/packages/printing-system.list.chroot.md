# Printing System

____

```

The Common UNIX Printing System (or CUPS(tm)) is a printing system and
general replacement for lpd and the like.  It supports the Internet
Printing Protocol (IPP), and has its own filtering driver model for
handling various document types.

This package provides the parts of CUPS which are needed for using printer
drivers.
System-config-printer is a GUI written in Python using GTK+ to
configure a CUPS server. Its primary use is to configure the printing
system on the local host, but can also be used to setup a remote
printer.

In terms of features, it aims to be as complete as the CUPS web
administration tool, while being integrated to the desktop.
