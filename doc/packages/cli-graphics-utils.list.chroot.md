__image manipulation programs -- binaries__

```

ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B?zier curves.
All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
an X11 graphical interface (display).

This package include links to quantum depth specific binaries and manual
pages.
