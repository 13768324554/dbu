# System configuration utilities

__graphical application for managing Xfce settings__

```

xfce4-settings is the Xfce settings manager front-end. It comes
with several different components for configuring application-independent
settings inside xfconf.
It contains multiple tools:
 - xfce4-settings-manager (which replaces the old mcs settings manager),
   which executes the various (provided) settings dialogs
 - xfce4-settings-editor, a tool for editing ALL settings within xfconf, the
   graphical counterpart of xfconf-query.
 - xfsettingsd, a daemon for exporting XSettings to applications, and
   providing special features like keyboard shortcuts, AccessX notification
   and update of keyboard and mouse-pointer data.
The GNOME System Tools are a fully integrated set of tools aimed to make easy
the job that means the computer administration on an UNIX or Linux system.
They're thought to help from the new Linux or UNIX user to the system
administrators.

Its main advantages are:
 * Full integration with the new GNOME Control Center.
 * An user-friendly interface to carry out the main administration tasks.
 * The use of a common user interface in every system.
 * A common structure that makes easy the development of new system tools.
Nowadays there are tools for managing:
 - Users and groups
 - Date and time
 - Network options
 - Services
 - Shares (NFS and Samba)
An advanced menu editor that provides modern features in a clean, easy-to-use
interface. All without GNOME dependencies, so even lightweight systems can
benefit from the sanity that MenuLibre offers. MenuLibre is your one-stop shop
for menus in Linux, whether you use GNOME, LXDE, Xfce, or Unity.
GConf-Editor is a tool used for editing the GConf configuration database.
This is not the recommended way of setting desktop preferences, but it might
be useful when the proper configuration utility for some software provides no
way of changing some option.
