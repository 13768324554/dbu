# Conky 

__highly configurable system monitor (transitional package)__

```

Conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
either on your root desktop or in its own window.
Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute
external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
lua support).

This is a dummy package to ease transition to the new packaging scheme.
It may be safely removed after upgrade/installation.
