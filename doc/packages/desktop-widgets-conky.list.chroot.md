```

Conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
either on your root desktop or in its own window.

external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
lua support).

This is a full conky with most compile options enabled:

X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon, RSS,
Weather, wireless, IBM, nvidia, eve-online, Imlib2,
apcupsd, I/O stats, argb, Lua and the cairo and imlib2 lua bindings,
Audacious, XMMS2, and PulseAudio.

```
