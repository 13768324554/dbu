# Network Manager

__network management framework (GNOME frontend)__

```

NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
services.

This package contains a systray applet for GNOME's notification area but it
also works for other desktop environments which provide a systray like KDE
or Xfce.
It displays the available networks and allows users to easily switch between
them. For encrypted networks it will prompt the user for the key/passphrase
and it can optionally store them in the gnome-keyring.
