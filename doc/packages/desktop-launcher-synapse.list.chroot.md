# Synapse launcher

__semantic file launcher__

```

Synapse is a graphical launcher enabling you to start applications and also
to quickly find and access relevant documents and files (by making use of the
Zeitgeist engine).
Zeitgeist is a service which logs the user's activities and events (files
opened, websites visited, conversations held with other people, etc.) and
makes the relevant information available to other applications.

It serves as a comprehensive activity log and also makes it possible to
determine relationships between items based on usage patterns.

This metapackage depends on the Zeitgeist engine and a set of packages
(such as data providers) commonly used together with it.

This package contains the GNOME Activity Journal, a graphical user interface
which shows a journal of your activities.
