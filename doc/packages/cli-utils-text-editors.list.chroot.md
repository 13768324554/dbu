# Text editors - command-line

__small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico__

```

GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
(itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).

However, GNU nano also implements many features missing in pico, including:
 - feature toggles;
 - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support);
 - go to line (and column) command;
 - auto-indentation and color syntax-highlighting;
 - filename tab-completion and support for multiple buffers;
 - full internationalization support.
