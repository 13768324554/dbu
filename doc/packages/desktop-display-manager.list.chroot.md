# Lightdm Display manager

__simple display manager__

```

An X display manager that:
 * Has a lightweight codebase
 * Is standards compliant (PAM, ConsoleKit, etc)
 * Has a well defined interface between the server and user interface
 * Fully themeable
 * Cross-desktop (greeters can be written in any toolkit)

Additional software can be useful along with LightDM:
 * xserver-xephyr can be used to add a nested X display by calling
  'dm-tool add-nested-seat`
 * upower can be used to suspend the computer from the display manager
 * accountsservice is used to populate a user list with addition information.
