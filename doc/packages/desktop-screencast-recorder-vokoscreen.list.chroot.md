# Vokoscreen screencast recorder

__easy to use screencast creator__

```

vokoscreen can be used to record educational videos, live recordings
of browser, installation, videoconferences, etc. You can capture an
alone video or video and sound (via ALSA or PulseAudio).

The program is very simple and uses a minimalistic GUI. It also can
capture your face using a webcam in the same time, so this feature is
especially suitable for screencasting purposes. Another feature is the
direct capture from IEEE1394 digital cameras.

This program uses the ffmpeg features and saves the capture in some
formats, as AVI, MP4, FLV and MKV for video and MP3 for audio.
