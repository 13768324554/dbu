# Backup utility

__GNOME front-end for backintime__

```

Back In Time is a framework for rsync, diff and cron for the purpose of
taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. It minimizes disk space use
by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard links
for unmodified files if it has. The user can schedule regular backups using
cron.

This is the GNOME front-end for the backintime-common package. If you also
install the package nautilus-actions, it can be integrated with the Nautilus
file manager to provide context-menu options.
