# GNOME Font viewer and manager

__font viewer for GNOME__

```

This program can preview fonts and create thumbnails for fonts.
Font Manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily manage
desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools or editing
configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with the GNOME Desktop
Environment in mind, it should work well with other Gtk+ desktop environments.
